# Machine_Learning-Hw6
HW6 I implemented a three layer neural network, with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer using forward propagation, back-propogation, Stochastic Gradient Descent, relu, softmax, L1, and L2 Regularization. There were no other packages used other than Numpy and SciPy to check the gradient calculations.
